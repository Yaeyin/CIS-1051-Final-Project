# Preproposal
- pokedex
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- We want to do a pokedex but instead of pokemon it will be like animals with abilities, a biography, hp, and attack, and other stats
- the plan is to use the pokedex screen as a way to display all of the animals just like the pokedex in the pokemon games

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Billy Seng

## Do you have any questions of your own?
- how much work do you think this will take?
- what would we need to import from the library to make this possible?
